# Flask Web Site
 I created this website as a project to learn more about backend web development using Flask and SQLAlchemy. Throughout the project, I focused on building a robust backend system, so I didn't spend much time on the frontend design.

The website uses SQLite3 as the database, and I followed a tutorial series to learn more about building a web application from scratch using Flask. Along the way, I learned about how to work with databases, how to use SQLAlchemy to manage data, and how to integrate Flask with other tools.

While the frontend design may be simple, the website's backend is where the magic happens. I worked hard to create a system that is efficient, effective, and reliable. I'm excited to share my work with you and to continue learning more about backend web development with Flask.

Overall, this website is a reflection of my dedication to learning new skills and expanding my knowledge of web development. I hope that it can be a helpful resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about building web applications using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
